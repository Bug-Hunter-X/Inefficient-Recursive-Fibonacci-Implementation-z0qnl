# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence and provides an optimized solution.

The `bug.py` file contains the inefficient recursive function. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a much more efficient iterative solution.

The inefficiency stems from repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers.  The recursive calls create a massive call tree, leading to exponential time complexity.
